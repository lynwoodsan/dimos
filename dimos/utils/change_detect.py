"""Change detection utility for file content hashing.

Tracks whether a set of files (by path, directory, or glob pattern) have
changed since the last check. Useful for skipping expensive rebuilds when
source files haven't been modified.

Path entries are type-dispatched:

- ``str`` / ``Path`` / ``LfsPath`` — treated as **literal** file or directory
  paths (no glob expansion, even if the path contains ``*``).
- ``Glob`` — expanded with :func:`glob.glob` to match filesystem patterns.
